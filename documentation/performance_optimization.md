# Performance Optimizations

This document tracks the performance improvements of the `chapaty` software, focusing on the time it takes to backtest 20,000 trades. By recording the optimizations made in each version, this serves as both a transparency report and a motivator to continue enhancing the efficiency of the software.

## Performance Overview

The chart below demonstrates the average time taken to backtest 20,000 trades across different versions of the software. Each point on the graph represents a new release where optimizations were applied to improve performance.
